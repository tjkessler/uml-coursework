RSA and SHA-384 implementation

- demo_encryption.ipynb: demonstrates RSA encryption/decryption of messages and files
- demo_keygen.ipynb: demonstrates RSA key generation methods (i.e., exact prime calculation vs. Miller-Rabin prime estimation)
- demo_sha.ipynb: demonstrates message and file hashing using SHA-384
- project_requirements.ipynb: project requirements, i.e., signing a hashed message/file with RSA private key, verify with public key
